## 📊 Why It Was Taking So Long

The first Docker build takes time because:

1. **Dependency Installation**: Installing all Python packages (LiveKit, OpenAI, etc.)
2. **Image Building**: Building Next.js production bundle
3. **System Packages**: Installing ffmpeg, build tools, etc.

**Total Time**: 5-10 minutes for first build  
**Next Time**: Much faster (uses cached layers)
