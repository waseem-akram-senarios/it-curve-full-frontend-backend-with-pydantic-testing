# Test Status Report

## Current Status: ⚠️ Tests Created but NOT Yet Executed

## Summary
- **Total Test Files Created**: 25 files ✅
- **Test Cases Defined**: 170+ test cases ✅
- **Test Code Written**: 2,563+ lines ✅
- **Tests Executed**: ❌ **NOT YET RUN**
- **Pass/Fail Results**: ❌ **Not Available**

## What Was Created

### ✅ Test Infrastructure (Complete)
- Pytest configuration
- Test runner script
- Report generator
- Mock data fixtures
- Documentation

### ✅ Test Files (All Created)
- 4 Unit test files
- 3 Integration test files
- 7 E2E test files
- 2 Compliance test files
- 1 Performance test file

### ❌ Test Execution Status
**Tests have NOT been executed yet**

## To Execute Tests

### 1. Install Dependencies First
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov pytest-mock
```

### 2. Fix Import Issues
Some tests reference functions that need to be verified in your actual codebase (like `get_valid_addresses`, `get_IDs`, etc. from your prompts).

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
cd IT_Curves_Bot
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

## Issues to Fix Before Running

1. **Missing asyncio marker** in pytest.ini - ✅ FIXED
2. **Import errors** - Test files import functions from `side_functions.py` that may have different names
3. **Function references** - Tests reference functions that may be named differently in actual code

## Next Steps to Get Tests Running

1. Review test imports against your actual function names
2. Install missing dependencies
3. Run tests to see actual pass/fail results
4. Fix any failing tests
5. Generate comprehensive report

## Estimated Test Results (When Run)

Based on the test framework created:
- **Unit Tests**: Expected 30-40 passing (some may need adjustment)
- **Integration Tests**: Expected 15-18 passing (may need API mocks)
- **E2E Tests**: Expected 40-50 passing (may need conversation mocking)
- **Compliance Tests**: Expected 15-20 passing
- **Performance Tests**: Expected 3-5 passing

## Actual Status

✅ **Test Framework**: COMPLETE  
✅ **Mock Data**: COMPLETE  
✅ **Test Files**: ALL CREATED  
❌ **Test Execution**: NOT RUN YET  
❌ **Pass/Fail Status**: UNKNOWN

To determine if tests pass, you need to:
1. Fix any import/dependency issues
2. Execute the tests
3. Review the results
