# 🚀 QUICK FIX: Run These Commands

## Fix Applied
Fixed UnboundLocalError in main.py (line 525)
- Problem: x_call_id not initialized before use
- Solution: Added x_call_id = None early in entrypoint function

## Commands to Rebuild and Restart

sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose build backend --no-cache
sudo docker compose up -d
sudo docker compose logs -f backend

## After Restart: What to Look For

✅ "Initial greeting sent"
✅ "Audio input RE-ENABLED"  ← CRITICAL
❌ No "UnboundLocalError"

## Test
Call the agent and say "I want to book a ride"
It should respond instead of getting stuck in "Thinking..."
