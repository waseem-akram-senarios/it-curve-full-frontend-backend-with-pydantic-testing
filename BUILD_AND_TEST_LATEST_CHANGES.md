## 🧪 TESTING YOUR LATEST CHANGES

### Test 1: "Nearest Coffee Shop" Scenario

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Agent: "Where should I pick you up?"
User: "8700 snouffer school road gaithersburg maryland"

Agent: "Where are you headed?"
User: "nearest coffee shop"

Agent: "Let me search that for you."
Agent: [Calls search_web function]
Agent: "I found Coffee Republic at 801 Pleasant Dr, Rockville, MD. Is that correct?"

❌ SHOULD NOT say: "I can't search online" or reject
✅ SHOULD: Search and find locations
```

### Test 2: Invalid Address Validation

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Agent: "Where should I pick you up?"
User: "Main Street"

Agent: "Invalid address format: Address is too short or incomplete. 
       Please provide a complete address with street name and number."
```

### Test 3: Phone Validation

**Expected Behavior:**
```
Agent: "What's your phone number?"
User: "4567"

Agent: "Phone number validation failed: must be at least 10 digits (you provided 4 digits). 
       Please provide a valid phone number with at least 10 digits."
```

## 📊 VERIFICATION AFTER BUILD

### Check Container Status:
```bash
sudo docker compose ps

# Expected output:
# NAME                     STATUS          PORTS
# voice-agent-backend      Up 30 seconds   0.0.0.0:11000->11000/tcp
# voice-agent-frontend     Up 30 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp
```

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
sudo docker compose logs backend | tail -50

# Look for:
# ✅ "Validation Middleware initialized"
# ✅ "Response formatter integrated"
# ✅ No import errors
```

### Check Frontend Logs:
```bash
sudo docker compose logs frontend | tail -50

# Look for:
# ✅ "Compiled successfully"
# ✅ No errors
```

### Test Health Endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11000/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok"}
```
