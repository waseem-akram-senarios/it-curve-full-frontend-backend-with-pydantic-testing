# üîß Fix "Thinking" Mode Issue

## üîç PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS

**Symptom**: Agent stuck in "Thinking..." mode after greeting  
**User reports**: "Hello! My name is Alina... Thinking..." and nothing happens

### Root Cause Analysis:

From `main.py` line 412:
```python
session.input.set_audio_enabled(False)  # Audio DISABLED after greeting
```

From `main.py` line 960:
```python
session.input.set_audio_enabled(True)  # Should re-enable after API fetch
```

**The Problem**: Something is preventing the API fetch from completing, so audio never gets re-enabled.

---

## üîç POTENTIAL CAUSES

### 1. API Call Hanging
- `get_client_name` function might be timing out
- Network issues with API endpoints
- Invalid credentials in `.env` file

### 2. Exception During API Fetch
- An exception is thrown during rider profile fetch
- Audio is disabled but never re-enabled
- Session stuck waiting for response

### 3. Cache Issues
- Cached data might be invalid
- Cache file might be corrupted
- Need to clear cache

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES

### Fix 1: Check .env File

**Verify API credentials are set**:
```bash
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1/IT_Curves_Bot
cat .env | grep -E "SEARCH_CLIENT_DATA_API|TWILIO|LIVEKIT"
```

### Fix 2: Clear Cache

```bash
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1/IT_Curves_Bot
rm -rf cache/*.pkl
```

### Fix 3: Check Logs

The logs should show where it's getting stuck. Look for:
- API call messages
- "APIs fetched and processing complete"
- "Audio input RE-ENABLED"

### Fix 4: Add Timeout Protection

The code should have a timeout fallback. Check if it exists.

---

## üîß QUICK FIX COMMAND

Run this to clear cache and restart:

```bash
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1/IT_Curves_Bot
rm -rf cache/*.pkl logs/conversations/*.json

# Then restart Docker
cd ..
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose up -d
```

---

## üìä HOW TO INVESTIGATE

### Step 1: Check Logs
```bash
sudo docker compose logs backend | grep -E "Audio input|API|fetching" | tail -50
```

### Step 2: Check API Status
```bash
# Test if API is accessible
curl http://localhost:11000/health
```

### Step 3: Check Cache Files
```bash
ls -lh IT_Curves_Bot/cache/
```

---

## üéØ LIKELY SOLUTION

**Most likely**: Cache file issue or API timeout

**Try this**:
```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1/IT_Curves_Bot/cache/*.pkl

# Restart Docker
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker compose up -d

# Check logs
sudo docker compose logs -f backend
```

---

## üìù WHAT TO WATCH FOR IN LOGS

After restart, logs should show:
```
‚úÖ "Initial greeting sent"
‚úÖ "Audio input DISABLED"
‚úÖ "API fetching started"
‚úÖ "APIs fetched and processing complete"
‚úÖ "Audio input RE-ENABLED"  ‚≠ê THIS IS CRITICAL
```

If "Audio input RE-ENABLED" doesn't appear, that's the issue.

**Next**: Check logs to see where it's getting stuck!
