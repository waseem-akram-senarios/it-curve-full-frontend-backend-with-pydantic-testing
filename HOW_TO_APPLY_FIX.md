# 🔧 How to Apply the Fix for "Thinking" Mode

## ✅ Fix Already Applied
I've fixed the `UnboundLocalError` in `IT_Curves_Bot/main.py` (line 525).

## 🚀 How to Rebuild and Restart

### Option 1: Run the Script (Easiest)

```bash
./rebuild_with_fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands

```bash
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1

# Stop containers
sudo docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans

# Rebuild backend
sudo docker compose build backend --no-cache

# Start containers
sudo docker compose up -d

# Check logs
sudo docker compose logs -f backend
```

## 🎯 What the Fix Does

**Problem**: `x_call_id` was not initialized before use, causing a crash.

**Solution**: Added `x_call_id = None` early in the function (line 525) to prevent `UnboundLocalError`.

## 📝 After Restart

Watch the logs for these messages:

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- "Initial greeting sent"
- "Audio input DISABLED"  
- "APIs fetched and processing complete"
- "Audio input RE-ENABLED" ⭐ **CRITICAL**
- No "UnboundLocalError"

### ❌ If Still Stuck:
Check logs for errors and share them.

## 🧪 Test the Fix

After restarting:
1. Call the agent
2. Say "I want to book a ride"
3. It should respond normally (not stuck in "Thinking...")
