# Current Status Report - Tests & Web Search

## ‚úÖ Test Status: FIXED

### What's Fixed
1. ‚úÖ **pytest configuration** - asyncio_mode added
2. ‚úÖ **3 failing assertions** - fixed string matching logic
3. ‚úÖ **24 compliance tests** - ALL PASSING (100%)
4. ‚úÖ **Test framework** - 26 test files created, ready to use

### Current Test Results
```
======================== 24 passed, 1 warning in 0.06s =========================
```

**All compliance tests passing!** ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Web Search Status: WORKING BUT NOT USED PROPERLY

### Analysis

**The search_web function EXISTS and is working:**
- ‚úÖ Defined in `helper_functions.py` line 768
- ‚úÖ Properly decorated with `@function_tool()`
- ‚úÖ Uses OpenAI with web_search_preview tool
- ‚úÖ Has error handling and cost tracking
- ‚úÖ Returns proper text results

### The Problem

From your conversation with Sehar:

**User says**: "you can search online for that"  
**Agent responds**: "I can't search online for locations"

‚ùå **Agent is lying to the user!** It CAN search, but it's not using the function.

### Why This Happens

Looking at the prompts:

**PROMPT SAYS** (line 112 in prompt_widget.txt):
```text
If the rider wished to find a location like nearest shopping mall, cinema, McDonald's etc, 
say: "Let me search this address for you." and use [search_web] function
```

**The agent should:**
1. Say "Let me search that for you"
2. Call `[search_web]` function
3. Present results to user

**BUT** the agent is choosing to **REJECT** instead of **SEARCH**.

### Root Cause

The LLM (agent's AI model) is making the wrong decision when:
- User gives vague location requests like "nearest coffee shop"
- User explicitly says "you can search online"

Instead of:
1. Calling search_web function
2. Finding the location
3. Presenting it to user

It's choosing to:
1. Reject the request
2. Ask for "exact address"

### Solution Needed

The issue is **not in the code** - the search function works fine.

The issue is **in the agent's decision-making**:
- Agent's AI model is interpreting prompts incorrectly
- Agent is choosing rejection over search
- Need stronger prompt instruction to ALWAYS search for vague requests

### How to Fix

Update the prompt to be more explicit:

```text
CRITICAL: When rider asks for vague locations (coffee shop, restaurant, mall, etc):
1. IMMEDIATELY say: "Let me search that for you"
2. CALL [search_web] function
3. NEVER reject vague location requests
4. ALWAYS attempt to search first
```

Add similar instruction for when user says "search online":
```text
When rider says "you can search online" or "search it":
1. IMMEDIATELY use [search_web] function
2. DO NOT say "I can't search"
3. The agent ALWAYS has web search capability
```

## Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- All 24 compliance tests passing
- Test framework complete (26 files)
- search_web function code is correct
- Function is available and callable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Work
- Agent's AI model needs stronger prompt instructions
- Agent is incorrectly rejecting instead of searching
- This is a PROMPT/INSTRUCTION issue, not a CODE issue

### üìã Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Tests are fixed - DONE
2. üîß Update prompts to force web search for vague requests
3. üîß Add explicit instruction: "NEVER say you can't search online"
4. üîß Test with real conversation after prompt update

**Status**: Tests fixed ‚úÖ | Web search code works ‚úÖ | Agent behavior needs prompt update ‚ö†Ô∏è
