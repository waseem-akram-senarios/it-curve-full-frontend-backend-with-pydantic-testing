## What Worked Well ‚úÖ

### 1. Phone Number Validation

```
‚úÖ **Pydantic validation working** - Caught invalid phone number

2. 100 Nelson Street, Rockville, MD 20850

## Still Need to Test üîç

### Test Web Search Fix (Critical)

The conversation didn't test the web search fix. Let's verify:

```
Expected Test:
1. Say: "I want to book a ride"
2. Pickup: "8700 snouffer school road gaithersburg maryland"
3. Dropoff: "nearest coffee shop"
4. Expected: Agent should search and find locations
5. Should NOT say: "I can't search online"
```

## Observations üìä

### What's Working:
‚úÖ Phone number validation (Pydantic)  
‚úÖ Address verification with multiple options  
‚úÖ Return trip question (prompt compliance)  
‚úÖ Booking completion  
‚úÖ Response formatting appears clean  

### What to Test:
‚ö†Ô∏è Web search for vague locations  
‚ö†Ô∏è Response formatter (abbreviation expansion)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-LLM validation layer  

## Next Test Needed

### Critical: Web Search Test

Run this conversation to test the web search fix:

```
User: "I want to book a ride"
Agent: "Where should I pick you up?"

User: "8700 snouffer school road gaithersburg maryland"
Agent: "Where are you headed?"

User: "nearest coffee shop"

Expected Agent Response:
"Let me search that for you."
[Agent searches and finds Coffee Republic, Java Nation, etc.]
"I found Coffee Republic at 801 Pleasant Dr, Rockville, MD. Is that correct?"

Should NOT say: "I can't search online"
```

## Analysis of Current Conversation

### Good Signs ‚úÖ

1. **Data Validation Working**
   - Phone number validated (required 10 digits)
   - Address validated and matched

2. **Prompt Compliance**
   - Asked for return trip
   - Confirmed details before booking
   - Provided complete trip information

3. **Booking Success**
   - Trip booked successfully
   - All details collected
   - Payment method processed

### Areas to Verify ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Web Search** - Not tested in this conversation
2. **Abbreviation Expansion** - Need to check if "Ave" was expanded
3. **Response Formatting** - Need to check for symbols

## Recommendations

### Test These Scenarios:

1. **Test Web Search**
   - Say "nearest coffee shop" for dropoff
   - Verify agent searches instead of rejecting

2. **Test Abbreviation Expansion**
   - Check if agent says "Avenue" not "Ave"
   - Check if agent says "Maryland" not "MD"

3. **Test Response Cleanliness**
   - No asterisks (*) in response
   - No hashes (#) in response
   - No dashes (-) except in co-pay

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ Agent working well with optimized prompts

**What Changed**:
- Prompts are cleaner (no validation rules)
- Pydantic handles validation
- Booking flow working smoothly

**Still Need to Verify**:
- Web search functionality
