# Docker Connection Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
The frontend was showing "Failed to connect. Please try again." when using Docker Compose.

## Root Cause
Next.js embeds `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables **at build time**, not runtime. The Docker image was built without these variables, resulting in empty values in the browser.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Frontend Dockerfile
Modified `ncs_pvt-virtual-agent-frontend-2c4b49def913/Dockerfile` to accept build arguments:

```dockerfile
# Read environment variables from .env.local
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_KEY

# Build Next.js application with environment variables
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL}
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_KEY=${NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_KEY}

RUN npm run build
```

### 2. Updated docker-compose.yml
Added build arguments to pass environment variables during build:

```yaml
frontend:
  build:
    context: ./ncs_pvt-virtual-agent-frontend-2c4b49def913
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    args:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL:-wss://voiceagesnt-i9430gnx.livekit.cloud}
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_KEY=${NEXT_PUBLIC_DID_API_KEY:-aW5mb0BpdGN1cnZlcy5uZXQ:c88fS7UTHKIbU_Fwun9Bf}
```

### 3. Rebuilt the Frontend Image
The frontend was rebuilt with the environment variables properly embedded.

## Current Status

✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ **Backend**: Running on port 11000 and registered with LiveKit
✅ **Connection**: Frontend can now connect to LiveKit backend

## How to Verify

1. **Check Container Status**:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

2. **Check Frontend Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs frontend
   ```

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
   - Try to connect to the voice agent
   - Connection should now work properly!

## Key Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Rebuild everything
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## Notes

- The backend shows warnings about the `turn-detector` model, but this doesn't prevent the agent from working
- Environment variables are now properly embedded in the frontend build
- The connection flow: Frontend → `/api/token` → LiveKit → Backend agent
