# üß™ TEST SCENARIO - Booking Loop Fix

## What to Test
This scenario previously caused the bot to get stuck in a loop. It should now work smoothly.

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Bot
- Open: http://localhost:3000
- Click "Connect"
- You should hear: **"Hello! My name is Alina, your digital agent."** (No "retrieving" message)

### 2. Provide Name
**You:** "My name is TestUser"

**Expected:** Bot confirms your name

### 3. Start Booking
**You:** "I want to book a ride"

**Expected:** Bot asks for payment method

### 4. Select Payment Method
**You:** "I will pay with cash"

**Expected:** Bot confirms and asks for pickup address

### 5. Provide Pickup Address
**You:** "Pick me up from 100 Main Street, Rockville, Maryland"

**Expected:** Bot verifies address and asks for dropoff

### 6. Provide Dropoff Address
**You:** "Drop me off at 200 Park Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland"

**Expected:** Bot verifies address and asks for time

### 7. Provide Time
**You:** "I want to go now"

**Expected:** Bot confirms time and asks about special requirements

### 8. Special Requirements
**You:** "No special requirements"

**Expected:** Bot summarizes trip and asks for confirmation

### 9. Confirm Main Trip
**You:** "Yes, all information is correct"

**Expected:** Bot asks about return trip (DO NOT skip this)

### 10. Book Return Trip
**You:** "Yes, I want a return trip"

**Expected:** Bot asks for return dropoff (should auto-set pickup to your first dropoff)

### 11. Return Trip Dropoff
**You:** "Drop me off at 100 Main Street, Rockville, Maryland" (same as main pickup)

**Expected:** Bot verifies and asks for return time

### 12. Return Trip Time
**You:** "One hour after my main trip"

**Expected:** Bot confirms return time and asks to confirm payment

### 13. Confirm Return Payment
**You:** "No, I don't want to change it" (or "Yes" to confirm cash)

**Expected:** Bot asks about special requirements for return trip

### 14. Return Trip Special Requirements
**You:** "No special requirements" (or provide requirements)

**Expected:** Bot says "I'll now collect your return trip details" and then "I'll now book your trips"

### 15. ‚úÖ CRITICAL - Booking Should Work
**Expected Result:**
- Bot books BOTH trips immediately
- Shows trip numbers for BOTH main AND return trips
- DOES NOT say "I missed collecting details"
- DOES NOT ask for addresses again
- DOES NOT transfer to live agent

### 16. Booking Confirmation
**You should see:**
- Main trip number
- Return trip number  
- Duration and distance for both
- Estimated cost for both
- Weather information

## What Was Broken Before:
‚ùå Bot would say "I realized I missed collecting the main trip details"
‚ùå Bot would ask for addresses again
‚ùå Bot would transfer to live agent
‚ùå Only one trip would be booked

## What Should Work Now:
‚úÖ Bot collects payload BEFORE booking
‚úÖ Bot books both trips together
‚úÖ No loops or repeated questions
‚úÖ Clean booking flow from start to finish

## How to Report Issues:
If the bot gets stuck or asks for information it already has, provide the exact conversation log so I can fix it.
