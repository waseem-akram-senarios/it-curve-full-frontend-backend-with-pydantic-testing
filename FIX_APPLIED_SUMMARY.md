# ✅ Fix Applied: UnboundLocalError for x_call_id

## 🐛 **Problem**
Agent was stuck in "Thinking..." mode with error:
```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x_call_id' referenced before assignment
```

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The `x_call_id` variable was only initialized inside a try-except block. If an exception occurred or the code took a different path, the variable was never initialized, causing a crash when trying to pass it to the Assistant constructor.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Added early initialization of `x_call_id = None` in `main.py` at line 525:

```python
# Before (line 552-560):
try:
    # ... code ...
    x_call_id = extract_x_call_id(participant.attributes)
    if x_call_id:
        # Set X-Call-ID
    else:
        x_call_id = None
    # ... rest of code ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error...")

# x_call_id used here at lines 858, 870, 875 - CRASH if not initialized!

# After:
chatbot = False
ivr = False

# Initialize x_call_id early to avoid UnboundLocalError
x_call_id = None  # ✅ NEW LINE

try:
    success = False
    # ... rest of code ...
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps: Rebuild and Test**

Run these commands to apply the fix:

```bash
cd /home/senarios/VoiceAgent8.1

# 1. Stop containers
sudo docker compose down

# 2. Rebuild backend
sudo docker compose build backend --no-cache

# 3. Start containers
sudo docker compose up -d

# 4. Watch logs
sudo docker compose logs -f backend
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After this fix:
- ✅ No more `UnboundLocalError`
- ✅ Agent should process requests normally
- ✅ If x_call_id is missing, it will be `None` instead of causing a crash
- ✅ Session should complete and audio should re-enable

---

## 📝 **What to Watch in Logs**

Look for these messages after restart:

```
✅ "Initial greeting sent"
✅ "Audio input DISABLED"
✅ "API fetching started"
✅ "APIs fetched and processing complete"
✅ "Audio input RE-ENABLED"  ⭐ CRITICAL
✅ No UnboundLocalError ❌
```

---

## ⚠️ **Note**

The root cause of "Thinking..." mode was this crash. After fixing it, the agent should:
1. Complete the API fetch successfully
2. Re-enable audio input
3. Process user requests normally

**Test by calling the agent again after rebuilding!**
