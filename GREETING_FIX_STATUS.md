# Agent Greeting Issue - STATUS UPDATE

## Problem
The agent was not greeting users because of a Docker network restriction with turn detection.

## Root Cause
The `turn_detection` using `EnglishModel()` was trying to download a model from HuggingFace, but the Docker container doesn't have outgoing internet access during initialization, causing the agent to crash before it could greet users.

## Solution Applied
1. Commented out the `turn_detection=EnglishModel()` line in the session configuration
2. Commented out the import for `EnglishModel`
3. Rebuilt the Docker image with the changes

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend is running without turn detection errors
- ✅ Agent should now start and greet users
- ⚠️ Turn detection is disabled (agent uses VAD for speech detection instead)

## What Changed
**File: `IT_Curves_Bot/main.py`**

```python
# Before:
from livekit.plugins.turn_detector.english import EnglishModel
...
turn_detection=EnglishModel(),

# After:
# from livekit.plugins.turn_detector.english import EnglishModel  # Disabled
...
# turn_detection=EnglishModel(),  # Disabled due to Docker network restrictions
```

## Testing
The agent should now:
1. ✅ Start without errors
2. ✅ Greet users when they connect
3. ✅ Respond to user speech using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) instead of turn detection

## Next Steps
1. Connect to http://localhost:3000
2. Try to start a conversation
3. The agent should now greet you properly!
