# Docker Setup Complete âœ…

Your Voice Agent application is now containerized with Docker!

## What Was Created

### Docker Files

1. **Backend Dockerfile** (`IT_Curves_Bot/Dockerfile`)
   - Python 3.10-based image
   - Includes all dependencies
   - Port 11000

2. **Frontend Dockerfile** (`ncs_pvt-virtual-agent-frontend-2c4b49def913/Dockerfile`)
   - Multi-stage Node.js build
   - Optimized for production
   - Port 3000

3. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Orchestrates both services
   - Sets up networking
   - Manages volumes for logs and cache

4. **Makefile**
   - Easy-to-use commands
   - `make up`, `make down`, `make logs`, etc.

### Documentation

- **DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md** - Quick reference guide
- **DOCKER_SETUP.md** - Detailed documentation
- **README_DOCKER.md** - This file

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start everything
make up

# View logs
make logs

# Check status
make ps

# Stop everything
make down
```

## Current Status

Your services are currently running in **non-Docker mode**:
- Backend: Process ID 17434 on port 11000
- Frontend: Process ID 18798 on port 3000

## To Run with Docker Instead

```bash
# First, stop current services
# (Find and kill the running processes)

# Then start with Docker
make up
```

## Next Steps

1. Test Docker setup: `make up`
2. Access: http://localhost:3000 (frontend)
3. Check logs: `make logs`
4. Customize as needed

## Important Notes

- Make sure `.env` files are configured
- Backend requires: MongoDB, LiveKit, OpenAI, Deepgram credentials
- Frontend requires: LiveKit URL and DID API key
- Adjust ports in `docker-compose.yml` if needed

## Support

- View all logs: `make logs`
- Check individual service: `make logs-backend` or `make logs-frontend`
- Get shell access: `make shell-backend` or `make shell-frontend`

Enjoy your containerized Voice Agent! ðŸŽ‰
