# Turn Detection + VAD Configuration

## Current Status
✅ **Both VAD and Turn Detection are ENABLED**

Your agent now uses BOTH systems for optimal conversation handling:
- **VAD (Silero)**: Detects voice activity and speech presence
- **Turn Detection (EnglishModel)**: Understands conversational context and natural turn-taking

## Configuration

**File**: `IT_Curves_Bot/main.py` (Lines 299-300)

```python
session = AgentSession(
    stt=deepgram.STT(
        model=deepgram_stt_model, 
        language="en",
        interim_results=True,
        smart_format=True
    ),
    allow_interruptions=True,
    false_interruption_timeout=2.0,
    resume_false_interruption=True,
    llm=openai.LLM(model="gpt-4.1-mini", temperature=0.1),
    tts=deepgram.TTS(model=deepgram_tts_model),
    vad=silero.VAD.load(min_silence_duration=0.75),        # ← VAD
    turn_detection=EnglishModel(),                          # ← Turn Detection
)
```

## How They Work Together

### VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
- **Purpose**: Detects when someone is speaking vs. silence
- **Method**: Audio energy/amplitude analysis
- **Speed**: Very fast, immediate detection
- **Use Case**: Quick response to speech start

### Turn Detection
- **Purpose**: Detects when a speaker has completed their thought
- **Method**: Semantic understanding of conversation context
- **Speed**: Slightly slower (needs context)
- **Use Case**: Natural conversation flow

### Combined Effect
1. **VAD** detects you started speaking → Agent begins listening
2. **Turn Detection** detects you finished your thought → Agent processes and responds
3. Result: Natural, responsive conversations!

## Docker Build Note

The Dockerfile has been updated to download the turn detection model during build:

```dockerfile
# Pre-download the turn detection model to avoid runtime failures in Docker
RUN python -c "from livekit.plugins.turn_detector.english import EnglishModel; EnglishModel()" || true
```

This pre-downloads the model so it's available when the agent starts.

## Benefits of Using Both

| Feature | VAD Only | VAD + Turn Detection |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| Speech Detection | ✅ Fast | ✅ Fast |
| Turn Completion | ⚠️ Based on silence | ✅ Based on context |
| Natural Flow | ⚠️ Can interrupt | ✅ Waits for completion |
| Contextual Understanding | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Interruption Handling | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Advanced |

## Testing

1. Connect to http://localhost:3000
2. Start speaking
3. Notice how the agent:
   - **VAD** quickly detects you're speaking
   - **Turn Detection** waits for you to finish your thought
   - Responds naturally at appropriate moments

## Current Settings

### VAD
- **Model**: Silero VAD v4
- **Min Silence**: 0.75 seconds
- **Status**: ✅ Active

### Turn Detection
- **Model**: EnglishModel (livekit/turn-detector)
- **Revision**: v1.2.2-en
- **Status**: ✅ Active

## Troubleshooting

### If agent doesn't respond
- Check logs: `docker compose logs backend`
- Verify both models loaded: Look for "preloading plugins" in logs
- Model will be downloaded on first use if not pre-downloaded

### If agent cuts you off
- Increase `min_silence_duration` to 1.0 or higher
- Turn detection should help, but may need adjustment

### If agent waits too long
- Decrease `min_silence_duration` to 0.5
- Turn detection will still wait for natural completion
